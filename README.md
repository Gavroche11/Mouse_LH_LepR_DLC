This repository contains the Python code used for the article "Neural Mechanism of Hunger-gated Food-seeking and Evaluating."

The file `helper.py` contains the auxiliary functions and variables we used: the description is provided in the file.

The file `test.ipynb` contains how we selected the specific frames, which will be further classified into 'Evaluating Behaviour (Lick)' and 'Swallowing Behaviour (Bite),' among the frames of interest.

The folder `Examples` contains the example data (from one of our trials) and expected output.
